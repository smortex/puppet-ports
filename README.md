# WIP FreeBSD Puppet 5 ports

This repository contains ports that are not yet available in the FreeBSD ports tree.

You are encouraged to test these ports and report success / failures to puppet@.

If you use `ports-mgmt/portshaker`, you can use the following configuration to merge these ports into the FreeBSD ports easily:

```
main_ports_tree="/usr/ports"
main_merge_from="ports github:smortex:puppet5!"
```
