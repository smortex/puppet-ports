This is a daemon written in Go that will replace the traditional combination of
Ruby MCollectived + Choria plugins - at least as far as the daemon side goes.

It will include at least:

- A vendored NATS instance fully managed by server.cfg with clustering support
- A Federation Broker for the Choria protocol
- An Protocol Adapter framework to rewrite message into other systems. For eg.
  Discovery messages to NATS Streaming.
- The mcollectived replacement that can run old ruby based agents
- Everything using a Go implementation of the Choria Protocol so interop with
  the Ruby clients and servers are maintained.
